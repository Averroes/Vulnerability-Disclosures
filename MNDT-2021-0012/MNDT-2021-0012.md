# MNDT-2021-0012

The Acclaim USAHERDS web application 7.4.0.1 and Earlier, builds prior to November 2021, used static `ValidationKey` and `DecryptionKey` values.  

## Common Weakness Enumeration

CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials

## Impact

High - Knowledge of the `ValidationKey` and `DecryptionKey` can be used to achieve Remote Code Execution on the system that runs the application.

## Exploitability

Low - The `ValidationKey` and `DecryptionKey` values would need to be obtained via a separate vulnerability or other channel.

## CVE Reference

CVE-2021-44207

## Technical Details

These keys are used to provide security for the application ViewState. A threat actor with knowledge of these keys can trick the application server into deserializing maliciously crafted ViewState data. A threat actor with knowledge of the `validationKey` and `decryptionKey` for a web application can construct a malicious ViewState that passes the MAC check and will be deserialized by the server. This deserialization can result in the execution of code on the server.
