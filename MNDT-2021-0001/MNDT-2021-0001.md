# MNDT-2021-0001
## Description
Mandiant discovered a vulnerability that impacts the Microsoft Windows operating system, allowing an attacker elevate privileges from a non-privileged user to SYSTEM by abusing a weakness in the Windows Print Spooler service.

## Impact
Very High - An attacker can abuse this vulnerability to elevate privileges on the local system. 

## Exploitability
Medium - An attacker needs local access to the target system as a low-privileged user.

## CVE Reference
CVE-2021-38671

## Technical Details
