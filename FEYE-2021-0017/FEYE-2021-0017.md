## Description
An integer overflow exists in pywin32 prior to version b301 when adding an access control entry (ACE) to an access control list (ACL) that would cause the size to be greater than 65535 bytes. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could crash the vulnerable process.

## Impact
Low - denial of service

## Exploitability
Low - Attacker must already have access to the object's access control list.

## CVE Reference
CVE-2021-32559

## Technical Details
An integer overflow causes a reduced sized memory allocation, which causes a heap overflow when an access control entry would cause the access control list to exceed the 65535-byte max size.

## Resolution
This issue was fixed as part of pywin32 version b301.
