# FEYE-2021-0002
## Description
Grandstream Networks' GRP261x VoIP phone running firmware version 1.0.3.6 (Base) is susceptible to an authentication bypass vulnerability in its administrative web interface. When combined with CVE-2020-25217, unauthenticated remote code execution as the privileged user `root` is possible. We suspect that this was introduced prior to firmware version 1.0.3.6, but it was not verified.

## Impact
High - An attacker with remote network access to a GRP261x could remotely compromise the device. This could be used to install malware, modify system behavior, or stage a more serious attack.

## Exploitability
High - When used in combination with CVE-2020-25217, an unauthenticated user with remote access to the administrative web interface could execute commands as the privileged user `root`.

## CVE Reference
CVE-2020-25218

## Technical Details
Mandiant discovered the GRP261x is vulnerable to an authentication bypass in the following API:

* http(s)://\<device\>/cgi-bin/direct-login

Mandiant determined that HTTP GET requests to this URL were processed by the server without credentials. The server responded with a valid `session-identity` cookie for the web role `admin`, which could then be used to access the administrative web interface as the authenticated user `admin`.

## Resolution
Grandstream Networks has fixed the reported vulnerability in [version 1.0.5.27](http://firmware.grandstream.com/Release_Note_GRP261x_1.0.5.27.pdf) (October 2020) of the GRP162x software.
