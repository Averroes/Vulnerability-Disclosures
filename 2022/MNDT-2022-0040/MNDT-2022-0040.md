# MNDT-2022-0040
Carel Boss Mini contains a privilege management vulnerability prior to version 1.9.0_Hotfix_20220930

## Impact
High - A low-privileged user can escalate privileges from the maintainer role to root on the underlying embedded Linux operating system. As Boss Mini is an HVAC controller, the attacker may be able to affect environmental conditions in the facility it is installed in, for example an art gallery, museum, or industry.

## Exploitability
Medium - Utilizing access to a maintainer account, such as by exploiting an easily guessable credential, an attacker can perform this attack with few skills and using open-source tools to proxy web traffic.

## CVE Reference
CVE-2022-34827

## Common Weakness Enumeration
CWE-284: Improper Access Control

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System
Base Score: 9.9 - Overall Score: 9.2 - Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C

## Technical Details
When making a simple configuration update, such as changing the system language, the entire system configuration is updated, being passed from the browser to the embedded web server. An attacker with access to the `maintainer` account can proxy this request and update their own account permissions.

An attacker can toggle the permission `"sidebar:view:/view/terminal":false` to `true` to enable access to a root terminal on the underlying embedded Linux operating system.

## Resolution
Carel fixed this vulnerability in version 1.9.0_Hotfix_20220930; please update to this version to address the vulnerability. **Note: Carel declined to have Mandiant verify/test their fix.**
