## Description
The "WP Cerber" (wp-cerber) WordPress plugin before version 8.9.3 improperly validated certain HTTP requests leading to a bypass of access controls on an API endpoint.

## Impact
Low - Bypassing the access control list allows an unauthenticated attacker to extract data such as users, posts, authors, and IP addresses from the WordPress REST API. This information may inform attackers' follow-on analysis.

## Exploitability
Medium - Exploiting this issue requires freely available proxy tools and a knowledge of common access control list bypass techniques.

## CVE Reference
CVE-2021-37598

## Technical Details
The Wordpress REST API endpoint located at `/wp-json`, by default, is blocked by WP Cerber from accessing its information.
By appending a `?` to the endpoint as if to add a URL parameter, the access control list protections are bypassed and data can then be retrieved from the REST endpoint.

## Resolution
This issue was fixed as of version 8.9.3 of the WP Cerber plugin.
