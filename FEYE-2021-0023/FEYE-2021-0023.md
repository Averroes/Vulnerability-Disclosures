## Description
The "WP Cerber" (wp-cerber) WordPress plugin before version 8.9.3 improperly checked certain HTTP parameters leading to an administrative multi-factor authentication bypass.

## Impact
High - An attacker can access unintended information and functionality without completely authenticating.

## Exploitability
Low - An attacker only requires a web browser to exploit this issue. However, the attacker requires knowledge of multi-factor bypasses techniques and would first have to compromise the user's username as well as password.

## CVE Reference
CVE-2021-37597

## Technical Details
When authenticating, the WordPress user is prompted to enter their 4-digit PIN code sent by email.
However, it is possible to access pages and directories behind MFA without submitting the PIN code by modifying the HTTP request in the following ways:

- Deleting the `wordpress_logged_in_[hash]` cookie
- Removing a character from the `wordpress_logged_in_[hash]` cookie
- Adding a character to the `wordpress_logged_in_[hash]` cookie

## Resolution
This issue was fixed as of version 8.9.3 of the WP Cerber plugin.
