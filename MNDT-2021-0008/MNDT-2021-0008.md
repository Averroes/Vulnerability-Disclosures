# MNDT-2021-0008
BeyondTrust Privilege Management for Windows contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability prior to version 21.6

## Impact
High - Exploiting the vulnerability will give a local unprivileged attacker SYSTEM level privileges. 

## Exploitability
Medium - Any authenticated local user can exploit the vulnerability and an exploit is trivial to produce.

## CVE Reference
CVE-2021-42254

## Techinical Details
The installation of the agent uses the Windows Installer framework and an MSI file is cached in c:\windows\installer. An unprivileged user can trigger a repair operation, either by using the Windows Installer API or by running "msiexec.exe /fa c:\windows\installer\\\[XXXXX].msi". 

Running a repair operation will trigger a number of file operations in the %TEMP% folder of the user triggering the repair. Some of these operations will be performed from a SYSTEM context (started via the Windows Installer service), including the execution of temporary files. 

## Resolution
The issue was fixed in version 21.6; update to this version to address the vulnerability.
